# Tic-Tac-Toe
# It took me just under 3 hours to make this code. I have never used GitHub before so I don't know if I uploaded it right.
# I didn't take any notes on paper, I just wrote the code.
# It is written in Python and I used Google Colab to make the code.
# If you just paste the code into a Python compiler then it should work.
